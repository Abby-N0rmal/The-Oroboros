              The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. Anything you want to do you can do here. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities.

              Those great big fluffy clouds. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here.
